This documents contains supplementary materials. 

The `crossref` options create two new types of floats: `suppfig` and `supptbl`. These floats are used to reference figures and tables in the supplementary materials with proper numbering. Labels for figures and tables must start with these keys instead of `fig` and `tbl` respectively.
